# Docker Setup Summary for GichevaArtAI

## What We've Accomplished

We have successfully set up a containerized environment for the GichevaArtAI application with the following components:

1. **Next.js Frontend**: Running on port 3000
2. **Flask API Backend**: Running on port 5000
3. **MongoDB Database**: Running on port 27017

All components are working together correctly, with the Flask API able to communicate with MongoDB and the Next.js frontend able to serve content.

## Architecture

Our Docker setup consists of two containers:

1. **GichevaArtAI Container**:
   - Contains both the Next.js frontend and Flask backend
   - Built using a multi-stage Dockerfile
   - Uses Python 3.11 as the base image
   - Has Node.js installed for running the Next.js application

2. **MongoDB Container**:
   - Uses the official MongoDB 6.0 image
   - Persists data using a Docker volume

## Key Learnings

1. **Multi-stage Builds**: We used a multi-stage Dockerfile to build both the frontend and backend in separate stages, then combined them in the final image. This helps keep the final image size smaller.

2. **Service Dependencies**: We configured the application container to depend on the MongoDB container and implemented a wait mechanism in the entrypoint script to ensure MongoDB is ready before starting the application.

3. **Environment Variables**: We used environment variables to configure the connection between services, such as the MongoDB URI.

4. **Volume Management**: We set up Docker volumes for both MongoDB data and uploaded images to ensure data persistence.

5. **Challenges Overcome**:
   - Resolved issues with MongoDB installation in the Debian-based Python image by using a separate MongoDB container
   - Fixed Node.js availability in the final container by installing it explicitly

## Next Steps

1. **Production Readiness**:
   - Implement proper logging
   - Add health checks for all services
   - Configure proper security settings

2. **CI/CD Integration**:
   - Set up automated builds and testing
   - Implement deployment pipelines

3. **Scaling**:
   - Consider separating frontend and backend into different containers for better scalability
   - Implement load balancing for production environments

## Running the Application

To start the application:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

To stop the application:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

To view logs:

```bash
docker logs GichevaArtAI
```

## Accessing the Application
